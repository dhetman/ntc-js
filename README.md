Name That Colour - JavaScript (Credit to Chirag Mehta)

Originally created by Chirag Mehta (http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/) is a very useful and free to use JavaScript file that allows you to feed in HTML colour codes (e.g. #FFFFFF) which will output the colour's name or at least its closest match. 

It was licenced under Creative Commons licence, therefore I feel I'm within my right to modify and freely redistribute it further. 

I placed comments in the index.html and ntc.js to demonstrate how these can be used. 

More examples coming soon.
